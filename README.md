# Rocket Relander


## Introduction
This work aims to develop a control algorithm to generate optimal control inputs that land the rocket's nonlinear, continuous time model. We aim to achieve the target trajectory with minimum energy consumption(saving fuel) and deviation from the landing spot in the presence of unmeasured wind disturbances.
