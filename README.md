# Rocket Relander


## Introduction
The objective of this work is to develop a control algorithm to generate optimal control inputs that land the nonlinear, continuous time model of the rocket. We aim to achieve the target trajectory with minimum energy consumption(saving fuel) and deviation from the landing spot, in the presence of unmeasured wind disturbances.
